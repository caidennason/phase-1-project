### Step Avenues for coming up with an idea
    * What problem do you have in your every day life you would like to solve?
    * What are you passionate about?
    * Fashion freaks who don't have all their things centralized into one place
    * Where are the ebikes
    * Bands who have toured with bands I like

### Step 2: Working on the overview
    * Brainstorm about what kind of features you would like to have, write them down as you think of them, example: 

    We would like to make an app that you create recipes, list out recipes, edit recipes, can delete recipes

### Step 3: List out all of the features
    * Take your notes from step 2 and make them readable
    * Example: (Make sure to tie your event listeners to what you do)
        * Form to create recipe (submit)
        * List out recipes (DOMContentLoaded)
        * A user can like a recipe (click)
        * A user can comment on a recipe (submit)
        * A user can delete their recipe (click)
        * A user can edit their recipe (submit)
        * A user can search their recipes (submit)

### Step 4: Come up with an MVP (This should be the minimum to pass the project -- the essentials)
    * Form to create recipe (submit)
    * List out recipes (DOMContentLoaded)
    * A user can delete their recipe (click)

### Step 5: Listing out your stretch goals
    * These should come after graduation
