### Step Avenues for coming up with an idea
    * What problem do you have in your every day life you would like to solve?
    * What are you passionate about?
    * Tracking the books I've read and want to read this year, and be able to rate them, leave comments, and indicate whether or not I own them

### Step 2: Working on the overview
    * Brainstorm about what kind of features you would like to have, write them down as you think of them, example: 
    I want to be able to submit the books I have read this year, the books I want to read this year, and mark whether or not I own the books I want to read this year. I also want to comment notes on the books I've read this year, and give a positive or negative button for that. 


### Step 3: List out all of the features
    * Take your notes from step 2 and make them readable

        * Form to list books (submit)
        * List out books (DOMContentLoaded)
        * A user can like the book (click)
        * A user can dislike the book (click)
        * A user can mark whether or not they own the book (click)
        * A user can comment on the book they read (submit)
        * A user can delete the book (click)
        * A user can search their books (submit)

### Step 4: Come up with an MVP (This should be the minimum to pass the project -- the essentials)

    * Form to submit book title
    * Form to submit book author
    * Form to submit month finished
    * Buttons to like or dislike book
    * Search bar for book
    * Button to delete book

### Step 5: Listing out your stretch goals
    * These should come after graduation
    * Where to buy the ones I want/how much they cost
    * Recommendations for books based on ones I've read
    * Form to comment on book
    * Button to edit book

### Things to think about/anticipated problems to solve
    * Search in the API isn't great unless you use advanced and look up title + author
    *
