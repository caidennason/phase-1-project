# Book Tracker
Overview goes here. Detail what it's about and it's purpose

This book tracker is a way for someone to list out the books they have or want to read. There are two links that lead you to the "Books I've Read" page and the "Books I Want to Read" page. Both pages allow you to look up a book by submitting the title and author. You can just submit either one, but the results won't be as accurate as submitting both. You'll have the books title, author, and a link to the book on openlibrary.org all returned when you submit. These will all have two buttons as well: a submit button, which logs the books you choose to submit, and a trashcan button that lets you delete the book (there are sometimes several entries for a book, and you can also delete them when you've submitted them so it's easier to navigate if you search another book). The books you submit include the name and author, as well as a trashcan button that allows you to delete the logged book, and a form that allows you to submit comments about the books.

The differences in these pages allows you to indicate whether or not you like a book on the "Books I've Read" section (heart button that turns orange if clicked), and whether or not you own a book on the "Books I want to Read" section (emply checkbox button that fills in if clicked).
